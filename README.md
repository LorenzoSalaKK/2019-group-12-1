## Project idea
**What if you could draw an infinite sketch? And what if you could share it with people and collaborate with them to continue their drawings?**
**Scribble Loop** is the answer!
Our inspiration comes from the artist [Pablo Rochat](http://pablorochat.com). He overcomes the limit of the artist canvas by creating an Instagram Stories “game”: he tags an artist in his story and invites him to go on with his first drawing and repost it.
We start our project inspired by Pablo’s idea and we make it bigger.
Scribble Loop is a web platform that allows everyone to create infinite drawings and collaborate with others. Each user can start with a preset drawing or can join a drawing that has already been scribbled by other users. The drawing will be saved and reloaded to allow other users to go on with it.
